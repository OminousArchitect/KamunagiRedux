## Introduction
This is 50% my vision of what a more mechanically diverse and nearly "perfect" Artificer would look like (with better perma-flight a la Ion Surge)

and 50% a love letter to ~~one~~ two of my favorite characters from my favorite video game ever made: Utawarerumono.

The Kamunagi of Chains are a caster character designed such that you can spec into survivability, raw dps, mobility, or summoning an army, but usually not all of those at once.

## Credits
- me, for envisioning this project and bringing it to fruition. I concepted all the skill ideas, made (or edited) all of the VFX, did all the SFX, worked in Unity animator controller hell, wrote all of the Secondaries, most of the Utilities, The Great Sealing, Light of Nature's Axiom, and Soei Musou: Hono Gekko.
- Bubbet for co-developing this entire mod with me and making ConcentricContent. Additional contributions include the zeal bar, 
the health overlay on Mashiro's Blessing, multiplayer compatability and networking, actually making the soundtrack replacement code work, helping port the project to SotS, and fixing 10 trillion errors in EffectManager. 
He also wrote Woshis' Miasma, Atuy's Sweeping Tides, Soei Musou: Seed, both passives, and ***all*** of the Divine Skills.

- bee9k for the model
- _ahvi for the animations
- Violet Chaolan for giving me guidance on Wwise and helping with the soundtracks
- previous code contributions for Sobu Gekishoha, Soei Musou: Jinsoku, and passive skill swapping by Dragonyck
- dgosling for providing me with the swirling chains visual effect <3

Thanks to these people for answering my questions in the modcord, this mod would be less polished without them
- HIFU
- pseudopulse
- Chinchi
- .score
- villiger
- Nuxlar
- shitter

## Additional Special Thanks
- to Bubbet for helping me with this entire project for absolutely no reason at all

- to RandomlyAwesome for being a cheerleader on this project since the very beginning

- Violet Chaolan and TheTimesweeper for beta testing and giving balance feedback


- and **most of all**, to Tsubasa, for introducing me to Utawarerumono.

## Known Issues
-- All feedback is welcome! Feel free to mention me in the RoR2 Modding Discord @Unit_9_Type_S
- Jump pads will lock your movement to zero if you use Dark Ascension without touching the ground after using them
- Clay templar tar blast will permanently force you in a direction until you land
- In multiplayer, clients can have an unlimited number of Nugwisomkami, this issue has been quite difficult to trace and I'm not sure if it'll be fixed, please summon responsibly, or don't >:)

## Misc. Dev Comments
The Kamunagi are somewhat lacking in animations for a couple reasons
- Working with two skeletons is pretty difficult not to mention tedious
- With Artificer as my precedent, she doesn't really have cast anims with a lot of motion either so *shrug*
- You're intended to be flying a lot of the time and making animations that work both on the ground and in the air is very tricky
- [I'm not asking someone to animate this shit](https://streamable.com/8hklxg)
- Animations are also expensive

## Future Plans
- Fix bugs
- That's it. I spent a really long time making this, I already did the plans
- Maybe item displays after I do a line of coke

## Changelog
-Initial Release
