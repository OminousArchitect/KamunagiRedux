## Introduction
This is 50% my vision of what a more mechanically diverse and nearly "perfect" Artificer would look like (with better perma-flight a la Ion Surge)

and 50% a love letter to ~~one~~ two of my favorite characters from my favorite video game ever made: Utawarerumono.

The Kamunagi of Chains are a caster character designed such that you can spec into a variety of roles based on the skills you equip.

- Completely impassable from the outside
## ![tatari](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/542ef5e7-86f1-4bb5-991f-5fe7674389c6)
- Chance to inflict a debuff on enemies scales with missing health, i.e. at 60% missing health it has a 60% chance to inflict a random debuff
## ![spirit](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f75eefde-2e16-4f56-91b3-e9c2003188d2)
- The Nugwisomkami of War exceeds in dealing damage and gains barrier on successive kills. This spirit is always **Perfected** or **Voidtouched.**
- The Nugwisomkami of Mischief has moderate damage output and high survivability. It teleports away to heal itself and cloaks on low health. This spirit is always **Overloading** or **Blazing.**
- The Nugwisomkami of Decay debuffs enemies with Weak, Slow, or Disabled Healing. It is the tankiest of the three and siphons health from nearby enemies. This spirit is always **Malachite** or **Celestine.** 
- Can only have 1 active spirit at a time
- Using the ability again with an active spirit will re-roll another one.
- Spirits are summoned at ambient monster level
- Decay and Mischief use Lesser Wisp AI and get confused sometimes, i.e. coming too close to the ground and then going braindead. I'm not sure what causes this.
## ![prayer](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/daa29165-830c-48d6-886c-c7981f9848ad)
- Lord Mashiro 'permanently' takes 10% of your maximum health as an offering upon completion of a successful prayer.

- You can only pray while out of combat
## ![kuko](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c15eb809-be03-4bcd-99ab-40855653b2b2)
- You can choose to forego a Divine Skill completely in favor of switching skillsets at will, for an even wider array of ability combinations
- All of your cooldowns reset when switching
  
This ability may or may not see a rework in the future, based on feedback.

## Credits
- me (Nines), for envisioning this project and bringing it to fruition. I concepted all the skill ideas, made all of the VFX, set up all the SFX, worked in Unity animator controller hell, wrote all of the Secondaries, most of the Utilities, The Great Sealing, Light of Nature's Axiom, and Soei Musou: Hono Gekko.
- Bubbet for co-developing this entire mod with me and making ConcentricContent. Additional contributions include the zeal bar, 
the health overlay on Mashiro's Blessing, multiplayer compatability and networking, actually making the soundtrack replacement code work, item display code, helping port the project to SotS, and fixing 10 trillion errors in EffectManager. 
He also wrote Woshis' Miasma, Atuy's Sweeping Tides, Soei Musou: Seed, both passives, and ***all*** of the Divine Skills.

- bee9k for the model
- _ahvi for the animations
- Violet Chaolan for giving me guidance on Wwise and helping with the soundtracks
- dgosling for providing me with the swirling chains visual effect and fixing the shader to work with Prime Meridian and Sulfur Pools postprocessing <3
- previous code contributions for Sobu Gekishoha, Soei Musou: Jinsoku, and passive skill swapping by Dragonyck
- sounds and music taken from Utawarerumono: Mask of Truth

Thanks to these people for answering my questions in the modcord, this mod would be less polished without them
- HIFU
- pseudopulse
- Chinchi
- .score
- villiger
- Nuxlar
- shitter

## Additional Special Thanks
- to Bubbet for helping me with this entire project for absolutely no reason at all

- to RandomlyAwesome for being a cheerleader on this project since the very beginning

- Violet Chaolan and TheTimesweeper for beta testing and giving balance feedback


- and **most of all**, to Tsubasa, for introducing me to Utawarerumono.
## Known Issues
-- All feedback is welcome! Feel free to mention me in the RoR2 Modding Discord @Unit_9_Type_S

- When rebinding skills, make sure to navigate with controller if you're using controller or navigate with k&m if you're using k&m, clicking with the mouse and rebinding with a controller input doesn't work. This is a vanilla problem and also extends to ExtraSkillSlots.
- Jump pads will lock your movement to zero if you use Proxy Apotheosis without touching the ground after using them
- Clay templar tar blast tends to permanently force you in a direction until you land(?)
- Summon Nugwisomkami has some difficult networking issues to trace, so it's disabled for people who aren't the host
- The particle FX for Honoka's Veil are broken somehow. I presume this is another "Gearbox removed grandparent boulder" situation. I'll fix it at some point
## Misc. Dev Comments
The Kamunagi have item displays too, but only as many as I felt like doing/ thought wouldn't look out of place. Most reds, yellows, void items, and items that "follow" you are done. I also did most of the Seeker's items too.

The mobility skills are available in either the Divine Skill slot or the Utility skill slot, to maximize available skill combinations. 

Comes with 3 custom soundtracks that play during the teleporter event on Titanic Plains, Sundered Grove, and Siren's Call.

The Kamunagi are somewhat lacking in animations for a couple reasons
- Working with two skeletons is pretty difficult not to mention tedious
- Using Artificer as my precedent, she doesn't really have cast anims with a lot of motion either so *shrug*
- You're intended to be flying a lot of the time and making animations that work both on the ground and in the air is very tricky
- [I'm not asking someone to animate this shit](https://streamable.com/8hklxg)
- Animations are also expensive

The animations they do have are based off of their moveset from Utawarerumono ZAN 2

## Future Plans
- Fix bugs
- maybe make Mashiro's Blessing a shareable buff
- That's it. I spent a really long time making this, I already did the plans

## Changelog
`1.1.1`

General:
- Reworked the behaviour for Proxy Apotheosis to trigger, making the skill feel more consistent. Made skill description more clear.
  - You can now dash around corners now by enabling "Variable dash direction" in the config. It's disabled by default 
- Changed Atuykarounkami's Passage to an alternate passive.

Balance:
- Buffed the blast radius and stun duration of Ennakamuy Earth. 

`1.1.0`

General:
- Maximum zeal is now configurable
- You can now disable the teleporter soundtracks if you wish

Balancing:
- Removed Death Mark from Sobu Gekishoha, it's too strong
- Atuy's Tides chance to fire a blessed projectile was previously 80% of crit chance because I was worried about it being op, it's been reverted back to 100% of crit chance now

Bugfixing:
- Fixed a bug where all other secondaries would scorch enemies

`1.0.6 to 1.0.10`
- Several breaking changes to damageTypes until I figured out how to do what I was trying to do

`1.0.5`

- Fixed Denebokshiri Brimstone not actually igniting enemies
- Fixed soundtrack blowing your eardrums off. Again super sorry about that :/

`1.0.4`
- Added recommended loadout to the readme
- Temporarily disabled soundtracks. I am REALLY sorry if I blew your eardrums out with static, this worked completely fine for me when I tested it, but of course everything has to break as soon as you upload it :,)

`1.0.3`
- Fixed sounds for Atuykarounkami's Passage
- Fixed attack speed scaling for Soei Musou: Jinsoku

`1.0.2`
- Fixed issue where only direct downloads worked and downloading through mod managers didn't properly organize the directories, causing the mod to fail to load.

- Lobby sound was disabled for debugging, I re-enabled it
- Readme spelling errors


`1.0.0`

-Initial Release
